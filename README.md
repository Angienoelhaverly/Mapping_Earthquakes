# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
Maps allow us to explore, understand, and make decisions about our world. In this repository we will use javascript (GeoJSON) to create interactive maps to visualize earthquake data. GeoJSON data can be found in many apps that have a map feature such as ride-sharing, navigation, and food and package delivery services. Even location services on smart phones use GeoSJON format. In this repository we will explore points (ie addresses and locations), linestrings (ie boundaries for streets and travel routes), and polygons (ie boundaries zip codes and counties) as well as non-spatial attributes (ie earthquake magnitude). 
In this specific project we will traverse and retrieve GeoJSON earthquake data and tectonic plate data in order to populate a map. 
Also will use the Leaflet Library and an API.
